# medScribe: AI-powered Medical Report Assistant
medScribe is an algorithm designed to streamline medical report creation for healthcare professionals.
This project is a collaborative effort aimed at automating key tasks in the report generation process. 
It leverages advanced AI models for:

### 1. Speech-to-Text Transcription:

Utilizes Whisper, a multilingual speech recognition model, to transcribe audio recordings of patient consultations into text.
Whisper is trained on a massive dataset of diverse audio, ensuring high accuracy and handling various accents and backgrounds.

### 2. Intelligent Report Formatting:

Employs GPT-4, a powerful language model, to format the transcribed text into a standard SOAP format commonly used in medical report writing. 
The model understands the context of the conversation and structures the report with sections like Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.

### 3. PDF Generation:

Generates a professional-looking PDF document containing the formatted medical report.
This facilitates easy sharing, storage, and integration with existing healthcare systems.

## Current Stage:

This prototype is currently implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, showcasing its functionality and potential. Future development plans include building a user-friendly interface for wider accessibility.
